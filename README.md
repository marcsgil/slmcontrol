# SLM - LOQUFF

This is a package under development in the Quantum Optics Laboratory of Universidade Federal Fluminense which aims to control a spatial light modulator.

The display part is based on slmpy from Sebastien M. Popoff(https://github.com/wavefrontshaping/slmPy), with only minor modifications.
